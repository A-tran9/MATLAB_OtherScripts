%% Operating Initializations for: Keyboard responses, Sounds, IOPort, Screen %%
%Setting up basic operations for MATLAB EEG Experiment
%Coded by Alex Tran, PhD, (c) 2018
%Questions? 9trana@gmail.com, a_tran@hotmail.com

%****Keyboard****%

%Sets the default numerical codes for each key button-press on the keyboard; 
KbName('UnifyKeyNames');

%Defines the 3 variables for: checking if the key is down, the time at 
%keyboard check, and numerical code of the key that was pressed
[keyIsDown,keysecs,keyCode]=KbCheck;

%****Sound****%

%Sound card preparation
InitializePsychSound(1);%add a 1?
Priority(1);

%Sets a call-able handle 'audhand' to the audio operations
audhand = PsychPortAudio('Open', 9, [], 1, 48000, 2, [], 0.1); %Added DeviceID 10 for lowest latency sounds
% whatbias=PsychPortAudio('LatencyBias', audhand);

%Read's .wav files, assigns them to a two-column variable, 'stndy' and
%'stly' and takes the frequency from the startle wave file
[stndy, ~] = psychwavread('standard.wav');
[stly, freq] = psychwavread('start.wav');

%Transposes the variables to a two-row variable to be read by the
%PsychAudioPort, as a two-column variable cannot be played as a sound
stnd=stndy';
stl=stly';

%****IOPort****%

%Creates a virtual serial port with call-able handle 'TPort' based on COM3 
%(check in Device Manager what the identity of the serial port is when 
%connecting the trigger box to confirm)
[TPort]=IOPort('OpenSerialPort','COM3','FlowControl=none SendTimeout=0.5 StopBits=1');

%****Screen****%
%Defines the basic colours of the screen: white, grey and black
%Other colours MUST BE DEFINED if you would like to use them
white = WhiteIndex(0);
grey = white / 2;
black = BlackIndex(0);

%Initializes the screen, gives the screen the call-able handle 'nwind' and
%sets the variable 'rect' to be the screen resolution.
%rect is a 4-column variable with the 3rd-column being the width, and the 
%4th-column is the height it also fills the screen white (which was defined above)
[nwind, rect]=Screen('OpenWindow',0,white);

%Sets default text size for the 'nwind' screen handle
Screen('TextSize',nwind, 40);

%These variables determine the center of the screen based on the 'rect'
%variable and names them as v_res (vertical resolution) and h_res
%(horizontal), it also determines the center point of vertical and
%horizontal
v_res = rect(4);
h_res = rect(3);
v_center = v_res/2;
h_center = h_res/2;

%Assigns 'fixation' to be a variable representing the center of the screen
fixation = [h_center-10 v_center-10];

%Naming and assigning values to our triggers stimuli (they must be 8-bit 
%integers) for more help search the 'uint8' function; 
%Note: it creates an 8-bit value from the number you put in, however because 
%it only has a max of 8-bits, the triggers number inputs will not be the
%number you get as a trigger output (e.g., uint8(17) will not appear as the 
%trigger number 17)

blstltrig1=uint8(1);
blstndtrig1=uint8(2);
blstltrig2=uint8(4);
blstndtrig2=uint8(5);
blstltrig3=uint8(9);
blstndtrig3=uint8(11);
